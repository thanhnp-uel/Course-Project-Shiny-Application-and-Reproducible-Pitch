## The Course Project

This is a deliverable for the course Developing Data Products as part of the Coursera Data Science Specialization.

### Instructions:

    1. Write a shiny application with associated supporting documentation. 
      The documentation should be thought of as whatever a user will 
      need to get started using your  application.
    2. Deploy the application on Rstudio's shiny server
    3. Share the application link by pasting it into the provided text box
    4. Share your server.R and ui.R code on github


## How to use the application

Using the data from Diameter, Height and Volume for Black Cherry Trees (R trees dataset), we fit a linear model to predict a Tree height based on the tree diamter and tree volume.

The application is running on https://rmjr.shinyapps.io/finalproject/)

ui.R, and Server.R Code in my github repository
(https://github.com/rmarasiganjr/Course-Project-Shiny-Application-and-Reproducible-Pitch)

## Trees Dataset {.smaller}
Dataset contains the Diameter, Height and Volume for Black Cherry Trees.

- Girth 	numeric 	Tree diameter (rather than girth, actually) in inches
- Height	numeric 	Height in ft
- Volume	numeric 	Volume of timber in cubic ft
```{r summary, echo = FALSE}
summary(trees)
```

## Plot

```{r plot, echo = FALSE}
library(HistData)
data(trees)
plot(jitter(trees$Height) ~ trees$Girth,xlab="Average Diameter of the Cheery Trees (in ft)",ylab="Height of the Cheery Trees (in ft)",main="Scatterplot of the Black Cherry Trees",pch=19,frame.plot=FALSE,col="light blue")
legend(65,80,pch=c(19,19),col=c("Red"),c("Trees"),bty="o",cex=.8)
```
